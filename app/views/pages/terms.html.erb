        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">1. Introduction & Acceptance</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">These terms govern your use of the Billdeck web application (billdeck.app), including its installable Progressive Web App (PWA) version.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">By creating an account or using the service, you accept these terms.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Billdeck reserves the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. Service Description</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Billdeck is a tool that helps freelancers organize client information, draft proposals, and create invoices.</p>
        <p>It is a productivity and communication tool—not a legal, financial, accounting, or payment processing platform.</p>

          3. Proposals and Invoices Are Not Legally Binding
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white/90"><strong>Proposals</strong> created and sent through Billdeck are informational documents intended to communicate scope, pricing, and terms between a freelancer and their client. They do <strong>not</strong> constitute legally binding contracts, enforceable agreements, or formal offers under any jurisdiction's contract law unless independently validated by a licensed legal professional.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">The "digital acceptance" feature—which records a name, IP address, and timestamp when a client accepts a proposal—is provided as a <strong>record of acknowledgment</strong> for communication purposes only. It does <strong>not</strong> by itself create a legally binding signature, a contract, or enforceable consent under electronic signature laws (such as ESIGN, eIDAS, or equivalent legislation). Users who require legally binding agreements must use dedicated e-signature platforms and consult with legal counsel.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white/90"><strong>Invoices</strong> created through Billdeck are informational documents intended to communicate amounts owed. They are <strong>not</strong> legal demands, certified financial documents, or tax-compliant instruments. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their invoices comply with the tax, accounting, and invoicing laws of their jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">Billdeck does not verify, validate, or guarantee the legal enforceability of any proposal, acceptance, or invoice created through the platform.</p>
        <p class="mb-0 text-amber-200/90 font-medium">Billdeck is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for legal contracts, accounting software, or professional legal and financial advice.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">All content created through Billdeck—including client data, proposals, invoices, and templates—is created and managed entirely by you. Billdeck does not review, verify, or endorse any user content.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Freelancers enter and manage their clients' data (name, email, phone, company, language). Billdeck stores this data on behalf of the freelancer.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Freelancers are solely responsible for having the appropriate legal basis (such as consent or legitimate interest) to store and process their clients' personal information through Billdeck.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Billdeck acts as a data processor on the freelancer's instructions. Freelancers are the data controllers with respect to their clients' data.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Proposals and invoices can be shared via unique tokenized URLs (<code class="text-accent">/p/:token</code> and <code class="text-accent">/i/:token</code>). These links are accessible without login.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You are responsible for sharing these links only with intended recipients.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Billdeck is not liable for unauthorized access resulting from users sharing links publicly or insecurely.</p>
        <p>Public links may be revoked at any time by deleting or modifying the underlying proposal or invoice.</p>
